------------------------------------
- Your Must Have To Turn on 2-Step Verification On Your Gmail Account. (Log in -> Google Account -> Security -> Signing in to Google => 2-step Verification)
- Then Go To App Passwords. (Log in -> Google Account -> Security -> Signing in to Google => App passwords)
- Go To Select App (Pick 'other (customer name)') Then Type 'server = smtplib.SMTP_SSL('smtp.gmail.com', 465)'.
